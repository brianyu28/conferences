The Crimson launched the Flyby blog in 2009, which has continued to provide another outlet for more loosely written, but still well-reported and more opinionated content. This seminar will focus on The Crimson’s most recent initiative to launch a blog on College Admissions and use that project as a case study for how to create and successfully launch your own initiatives.</td>

This seminar will challenge students to examine a number of prominent (and even award-­winning) feature designs from The Crimson’s archives for what makes a design work and what doesn’t.</td>

                            <td>One of the most important functions of any newspaper is continuing the legacy of strong journalism after the current board of editors departs the organization. As such, few things take higher priority than training up-and-coming reporters.

In fact, The Crimson itself has already made a dramatic push towards alternative revenue streams than simply subscriptions and print advertisements.
