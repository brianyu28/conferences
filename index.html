            <h2>About the Crimson</h2>
            <p>The Harvard Crimson, the nation's oldest continuously published daily college newspaper, was founded in 1873 and incorporated in 1967. The newspaper traces its history to the first issue of "The Magenta," published on Jan. 24, 1873, and changed its name to "The Crimson" to reflect the new color of the college on May 21, 1875. The Crimson has a rich tradition of journalistic integrity and counts among its ranks of editorship some of America's greatest journalists. The faces of Pulitzer Prize-winning Crimson editors line the walls of The Crimson.</p>
            <p>The Crimson is proud of its legacy of alumni active in journalism, business, public service, and politics. Past editors include Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, John F. Kennedy '40, J. Anthony Lewis '48, David Halberstam '55, Michael Crichton '64, Don Graham '65, Linda Greenhouse '68, Steve Ballmer '77, Jim Cramer '77, Mark Whitaker '79, Susan Chira '80, and Jeff Zucker '86. One hundred and forty years after its founding, having grown from a fortnightly newspaper to a daily, The Harvard Crimson continues to flourish with a strong body of undergraduate staff volunteers.</p>
