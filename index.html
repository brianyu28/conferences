            <h2>What Students Say</h2>
            <blockquote>The Summer Journalism Academy was the highlight of my summer and an unforgettable experience. Not only did I get the opportunity to meet a group of interesting students from nearby schools, but it showed me what real reporting was like and I learned reporting skills that I have carried with me to this day. The staff members were all great mentors, giving me the confidence I needed, and it was really great getting such talented writers to edit my work in a one-on-one setting.</blockquote>
