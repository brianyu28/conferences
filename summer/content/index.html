        <h3>Forming the Feature: A Look at Long-Form Journalism</h3>
        <p>Some news can be covered in five hundred words or less, while other topics warrant extensive in-depth investigation and a more fleshed-out story.

        <h3>Column Writing: Making Your Point</h3>
        <p>Knowing how to form an argument well is an incredibly important and versatile skill, and in this seminar, students will learn how to craft an opinion on a controversial issue. At the same time, Crimson column editors will also teach the basics of column-writing, including how to find a topic and how to establish a unique tone and perspective for a column.</p>

        <h3>Lookin’ Good: Fundamentals of Design</h3>
        <p>Attention-grabbing headlines, clean graphics, and striking photos are just a few of the things that go into the making of a good front page. How to organize all of this content in a logical, coherent, and aesthetically-pleasing manner is the challenge that designers face. Students in this seminar will learn the basic principles underlying the layout of the daily newspaper.</p>

        <h3>Beyond A1: Features Design</h3>
        <p>From arts and sports sections, to the weekly Fifteen Minutes magazine, to the annual Year in Review issue, The Crimson’s content offers plenty of opportunities for more creative design ideas. This seminar will challenge students to examine a number of prominent (and even award-winning) feature designs from The Crimson’s archives for what makes a design work—and what doesn’t.</p>

        <h3>The Making of a Magazine: Alternative Ways To Tell a Story</h3>
        <p>In this seminar, editors of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes, will discuss ways to present campus issues using non-traditional narrative forms.

        <h3>Photo: Capturing a Thousand Words</h3>
        <p>How does one tell a story and bring an article to life with a single photo? This seminar will engage students with the question of what makes a photograph visually striking, while at the same time, challenging them to think about photos as journalistic creations. In the process, students will also be introduced to some of the technical skills and terminology to help them broaden their range of skills.</p>

        <h3>Video: Telling Stories That Move</h3>
        <p>A well-made video can tell an engaging story on its own or can serve as a valuable complement to a traditional article.

        <h3>Beyond the Game: The Investigative Sports Feature</h3>
        <p>There’s a certain thrill to covering an athletic event, but the world of sports journalism extends far beyond individual wins and losses. What goes into the making of a winning team, or the training of a successful athlete? This seminar will draw on recent feature stories on Harvard sports teams—including the Harvard men’s basketball team—as examples.

        <h3>Digging Through Data: The News Graphic </h3>
        <p>It can be easy for a reporter or reader to get bogged down in the numbers for a data-heavy story, but a chart or other type of graphic can be a clean way to cut through the noise and isolate a particularly important trend or pattern. Members of our design and news teams will teach students how to construct graphics by showing examples from The Crimson’s own archives.</p>

        <h3>Newspaper 2.0: Online Strategy</h3>

How can publications adjust to ensure that journalism remains a profitable endeavor? And what kind of impact are these trends having on college, and even high school, newspapers?</p>

        <h3>InDesigning the Paper</h3>
