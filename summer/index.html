            <h2>About the Academy</h2>
            <p>Led by our talented and dedicated summer staff, the Summer Journalism Academy will teach students a wide set of new skills—from news reporting and writing, to designing, to the business challenges of newspapers today—that will undoubtedly help them in the classroom and in their extracurricular pursuits.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the camp features activities outside the building, including tours of Harvard College in which students will learn about college admissions, college life and reporting in college. Students will also have the opportunity to go on a behind-the-scenes tour of The Boston Globe and sit in on a planning meeting conducted by the paper’s most important editors. On the final day, students at the Summer Journalism Academy get an opportunity unlike any other—to put their newfound knowledge to work right away, producing an actual newspaper!</p>
            <p>The week-long camp will run from 9 AM until 4 PM, Monday through Friday. This year, we will be offering multiple sessions of the camp, beginning in early July and running each week through early August. Exact dates can be found on the registration tab of this website. Financial aid is available on a case-by-case basis. Please reach out to <a href="mailto:{{ site.academy.email }}">{{ site.academy.email }}</a> with any questions you may have, and we look forward to seeing you this summer!</p>
            <h2>About the Advanced Program</h2>
            <p>The advanced program is designed for students who have some experience in journalism, whether at their high school newspaper or through internships, and are looking for a curriculum that goes beyond the fundamentals of reporting, writing, and producing a newspaper and includes extensive personal attention. We will go more in-depth with the writing process and interview techniques, and cover approaches to page layout using inDesign. Finally, the advanced program will emphasize leadership within the field of journalism, including issues related to journalistic ethics, institutional organization and strategies, and the editing process.</p>

            <h2>What Students Say</h2>
            <blockquote>The Summer Journalism Academy was the highlight of my summer and an unforgettable experience. Not only did I get the opportunity to meet a group of interesting students from nearby schools, but it showed me what real reporting was like and I learned reporting skills that I have carried with me to this day. The staff members were all great mentors, giving me the confidence I needed, and it was really great getting such talented writers to edit my work in a one-on-one setting.&nbsp;</blockquote>
