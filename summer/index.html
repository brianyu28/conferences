        <h2>About the Summer Journalism Academy</h2>
        <p>The Summer Journalism Academy strives to bring together aspiring writers and journalists at one of the most prestigious college papers in the country. Led by The Harvard Crimson writers, attendees will learn the ins and outs of the craft and discuss the issues common and high school, college, and professional newsrooms.</p>
        <p>While dissecting the various responsibilities of a journalist, attendees will use their newfound knowledge right away, pursuing their own stories and putting them on pages on computers. By Friday, students will have created a special Crimson edition of their own to take home along with their new abilities and experience.</p>
