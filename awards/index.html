                <p>The objective of The Harvard
                Crimson&rsquo;s Journalism
                Awards program is to recognize superb
                journalism produced at the high school
                level. We will be taking entries from
                nearly all aspects of journalism, with
                categories including general news,
                features, sports and arts, opinion, and
                overall reporter, along with multimedia
                such as photo, video, and newspaper design.
                Given the rise of digital journalism,
                online publications are also encouraged to
                enter via a dedicated award category. All
                entries are eligible to receive comments
                and critique, as well as access to grading
                based on our proprietary
                internally-developed rubric.</p>
